# Challenge

A command-line program to learn some programming concepts in Java.

Look for sections with "TODO" in the comments and modify them to make the 
"challenges" work. If you get them to work, the command-line output will
tell you.

The main Java function is in codewrought.challenge.Curiosity. Run this
from the command-line to test the program after compilation. Either
use an IDE (e.g. Eclipse) or via a terminal.

Challenge 01 is to learn how loop through an array and operate on it

Challenge 02 is to learn how to write recursive functions

Challenge 03 is to learn how polymorphism works

Challenge 04 is to learn how to sort integers

Good luck!
